<h3>About MoveFood</h3>
<p>
MoveFood is a tool for businesses to and volunteers to connect and get leftover food to people in need on an ad-hoc basis.
</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>
A business will post the food they have available and when it will be available for pickup. A volunteer can search the site or be notified automatically when some food becomes available within their designated range. The volunteer then “claims” the food on the site and picks it up from the business. The volunteer then delivers to food to a registered recipient or persons in need.
</p>
<h3>How do I get involved?</h3>
<p>
Sign up! Register your business as a source of food, sign up as a volunteer or as a destination/recipient. Depending where you live, there may be different requirements and restrictions to participating. If there isn’t a Move Food set up yet in your area, please contact us to find out how to go about getting a local version up and running for your area.
</p>
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>
For individuals that opt-in, it will eventually be possible to communicate and coordinate with others in your area. this will allow businesses and volunteers to pre-plan to make the efforts more efficient. For example, if a particular business usually has food available three nights a week, three volunteers would be able to coordinate between each other and pick a designated night and ask someone to cover is something comes up. While the system is designed to work on a ad-hoc basis, it’s strength really shines on forming repeatable patterns and forging relationships between the resources, volunteers and recipients.
