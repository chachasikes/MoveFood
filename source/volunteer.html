        <h3>As a volunteer, what is expected of me?</h3>
        
        We expect our volunteers to operate with the utmost of integrity. Please make sure that if you volunteer to pick up and deliver food, you abide by the following requirements:
        
        <ul>
          <li>Pick up within the posted time frame, and deliver to the appropriate destinations or persons in need.</li>
          <li>Make sure you have a reliable plan to distribute the food. Claim only items you are sure you can distribute.</li>
          <li>Distribute food donations only to legitimate recipients, as put forth in the “Legitimate Recipients” guidelines.</li>
          <li>Do not accept payment for donated items.</li>
          <li>Drive and act safely at all times.</li>
          <li>Follow local health codes and food handling laws. We require a food safety card or equivalent if available to volunteer for move food. This helps ensure that volunteers are properly trained in handling food, abiding by local laws and regulations and help ensuring the safety of the recipients. If there are no such laws/certification in your area, we recommend reviewing xxxxxx.</li>
          <li>After you “claim” food for a pickup, make sure to fully review the information and directions/instructions of the business that is offering the food. If you cannot make it for some reason, please notify the business as soon as possible, so the food can be re-listed and hopefully picked up by someone else.</li>
          <li>Once picked up, either you or the business can mark the items as being picked up. if you do not have a mobile device to do so, please ask the business to change the status.</li>
          <li>When you drop the food off, if it is a known location and they have the ability, ask them to verify the food was dropped off. If they do not, or you are delivering food to individuals, please note where and when you dropped the food off, and record it on the web site. This helps us track the delivery, monitor trends and efficiencies, and improve the overall system. It is important that each step of the process be recorded, so please make sure the “chain of custody” is documented.</li>
          <li>Fill in all the information asked for in the item claim form. (TBD) This information is necessary to ensure the food donations are going where they are needed.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>What does it cost?</h3>
        
        <p>There is a nominal registration fee involved to help with overhead and costs. Beyond that, it only costs your time and good intentions. No money ever changes hands. Ever.</p>
        
        <h3>How is my information used?/can anyone else see my personal information?</h3>
        
        <p>Your information is stored securely and is not shared with any other entity.</p>
        
        <p>By default, all your personal information is wholly private, save for your name and contact number/information which is only displayed to the businesses that you “claim” a pickup from. This is so that they can attempt to contact you between the time you claim a pickup and your arrival.</p>
        
        <p>If you so desire, you will be able to communicate, collaborate and create community with others that have also opted in. We will be rolling these community features out in the near future.</p>
